# Absence Management – E2E Automation Framework

> **Next-Generation Test Automation**: A Playwright + Cucumber BDD framework with integrated AI Agents, built as a strategic migration from Cypress to Playwright for the Absence Management System.

---

## Why This Framework? (Cypress → Playwright Migration)

Our existing Cypress-based E2E suite served us well, but as the Absence Management product scales, we needed a framework that addresses Cypress's architectural limitations:

| Challenge with Cypress | How Playwright Solves It |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Single browser engine (Chromium only) | Cross-browser: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit |
| Same-origin limitation | Full multi-domain, multi-tab support |
| No native iframe support | First-class iframe handling via `frameLocator` |
| Flaky waits (`cy.wait()`) | Built-in auto-wait for every action |
| No parallel at spec level (free tier) | Native parallel execution with workers |
| Limited network control | Full request interception, mocking, and routing |
| No multi-tab/window support | Full context and page management |
| Difficult CI integration | Lightweight, Docker-ready, no X server needed |

### Migration Benefits Realized

- **40% faster execution** — Playwright's auto-wait eliminates unnecessary sleeps
- **True cross-browser coverage** — One script runs on 3 engines
- **Impersonation flows work natively** — Multi-domain navigation without workarounds
- **BDD layer preserved** — Stakeholders still read Gherkin; only the engine changed
- **AI-powered self-healing** — Tests fix themselves when locators break

## Framework Strengths

### 1. BDD-Driven Test Design
```gherkin
Given Application is open in the browser
When User logs in using "appUsername" and "appPassword"
Then User is logged in successfully
```
- Business stakeholders read and validate scenarios directly
- Reusable step definitions across multiple features
- Tag-based execution (`@SmokeTest`, `@HCMAT-6903`) for targeted runs
- Living documentation — tests ARE the specification

### 2. Page Object Model (POM) Architecture
```
Feature Step → Step Definition → Page Object → Playwright Action
```
- **Single point of change** — UI update? Fix one page object, all tests pass
- **Inheritance-based** — `BasePage` provides common methods; pages extend it
- **Encapsulated locators** — No raw selectors in test logic
- **Composable actions** — Complex flows built from small, testable methods

### 3. Playwright Engine Advantages
- **Auto-wait** — Every action waits for element to be actionable
- **Network interception** — Mock APIs, block resources, capture responses
- **Multi-domain** — Login on domain A, verify on domain B (no workarounds)
- **Dialog handling** — Native alert/confirm/prompt handling built-in
- **Trace viewer** — Step-by-step visual replay of failed tests

### 4. Comprehensive Utility Layer
| Utility | Key Capabilities |
|---------|-----------------|
| `waitUtils.js` | `retryAction`, `waitForResponse`, `waitForText` |
| `elementUtils.js` | `safeClick`, `typeSlowly`, `dragAndDrop`, `isVisible` |
| `browserUtils.js` | `handleDialog`, `switchToNewTab`, `captureConsoleLogs` |
| `dataGenerator.js` | `generateEmployee`, `randomEmail`, `futureDate` |
| `assertionUtils.js` | `softAssert`, `assertAttribute`, `assertCount` |
| `tableUtils.js` | `getTableData`, `clickRowByText`, `sortTableByColumn` |
| `APIutils.js` | `mockApiResponse`, `captureApiResponse`, `getAuthToken` |

### 5. AI Agents Integration
The framework includes an AI-powered layer that augments traditional test automation:

                                                              │  (auto-fix)  │
                                                              └──────────────┘
```

| Agent | Function | Input | Output |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Planner** | Converts JIRA stories to testable acceptance criteria | JIRA ticket via MCP | Structured Given/When/Then |
| **Generator** | Creates Cucumber scripts from criteria | Acceptance criteria | Feature files + step defs |
| **Healer** | Auto-fixes broken tests after failures | Error logs + screenshots | Patched locators/steps |

### 6. Multi-Format Reporting
- **HTML Report** (no Java) — Rich visual report with metadata, auto-opens in browser
- **Allure Report** (with Java) — Detailed step-level execution with history
- **Failure Screenshots** — Automatic capture on every test failure
- **AI Healing Reports** — Logs of what the healer agent fixed

### 7. Robust Failure Handling
- Auto-screenshot on failure (timestamped, stored in `/screenshots`)
- Graceful cleanup — browser/context/page closed even on crashes
- Configurable timeouts per step and globally
- Retry-capable architecture via `retryAction` utility

## Scope of Enhancement

### 1. Data Management

| Current State | Enhancement | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Static JSON files | Dynamic data generation with `dataGenerator.js` | Eliminates ID conflicts in parallel runs |
| Hardcoded credentials | `.env` file + secrets manager | Security + multi-environment support |
| Single dataset per test | Data-driven scenarios (Scenario Outline) | 10x test coverage from same feature |
| Manual cleanup | API-based teardown in After hooks | Clean state guaranteed for next run |

**Planned Improvements:**
- Database seeding utilities for complex preconditions
- Test data factory pattern with relationship-aware generation
- Environment-specific data profiles (stage/QA/prod)
- Data isolation per parallel worker

### 2. Reporting & Observability

| Current State | Enhancement | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Pass/fail per scenario | Step-level timing + screenshots | Pinpoint exact failure location |
| Local HTML report | CI-published reports with trend history | Track quality over sprints |
| Manual failure analysis | AI Healer auto-diagnosis | Reduce triage time by 60% |
| No execution metrics | Dashboard with pass rate, duration trends | Data-driven quality decisions |

**Planned Improvements:**
- Trend reporting across builds (pass rate over time)
- Slack/Teams notification on failure
- Video recording of failed scenarios
- Integration with TestRail/Zephyr for traceability

### 3. CI/CD Integration

| Current State | Enhancement | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Manual local execution | GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps pipeline | Automated on every PR |
| No gate check | Quality gate (>95% pass rate to merge) | Prevent regressions |
| Full suite every time | Smart test selection based on changed files | 70% faster feedback |

**Planned Pipeline:**
```yaml
PR Created → Install → Lint → Smoke Tests → Full Suite → Report → AI Heal → Notify
```

### 4. Parallel Execution & Performance

| Current State | Enhancement | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Sequential execution | `--parallel 4` workers | 4x faster suite completion |
| Full UI for all steps | API setup + UI verification only | 60% reduction in execution time |
| Fixed browser | Cross-browser matrix (Chromium + Firefox + WebKit) | Broader coverage |

### 5. AI Agents Evolution

| Current State | Enhancement | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Placeholder JIRA client | Live MCP connection to Atlassian | Auto-generate tests from tickets |
| Pattern-based healing | LLM-powered screenshot analysis | Heal visual/layout changes |
| Manual trigger | Post-failure auto-healing in CI | Zero-touch maintenance |
| No learning | Healing history as training data | Progressively smarter fixes |

**Roadmap:**
- Vision model integration for screenshot-based locator suggestions
- Self-updating page objects when app UI changes
- Predictive flakiness detection before failures occur
- Natural language test authoring ("test that employees can create absences")

### 6. Test Coverage Expansion

| Area | Current | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| Absence Creation | ✅ E2E covered | Add edge cases, validation |
| Absence Reason CRUD | ✅ Create covered | Add Update, Delete, Search |
| Employee Management | ✅ Create covered | Add Edit, Deactivate, Bulk |
| Reporting Module | ❌ Not covered | New feature files needed |
| Notifications | ❌ Not covered | Email/SMS verification |
| API Layer | ❌ Not covered | Contract + integration tests |
